      <h2 style="color:#E57C5F;">Risk in Youth Sport</h2>
      <p>Many young athletes are exposed to repeated head impacts, most often in high contact sports such as football or hockey, and a lot without showing immediate symptoms-which may not prompt families to help as much as they should. Studies show that football and hockey have the highest rates of concussions in youth sports. These sports are not small either, hockey having upwards of 400,000 players in the U.S. alone.</p>
      <p>In football, players who played non-contact football (flag football) received head collisions 15 times less than those who played the full contact version of the sport. Another study showed than players were 23 times more likely to receive head trauma when playing the sport.</p>
      <p>Awareness in CTE is essential in order to improve safety protocols, equipment, and standards.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#E57C5F;">Professional Sports Data</h2>
      <p>Former NFL players show much higher rates of CTE than the general population. Studies of some brains indicate that repeated concussions correlate with the chances of getting CTE. Boston University did a study in which 63 out of 152 (41.4%) of brain donors had CTE. This study was all done with former contact sport athletes.</p>
      <p>This data highlights the need for better measures and ongoing research in both youth and professional sports.</p>
      <p>Another study conducted said that 71.4% of people with CTE were men which had played contact sports such as football (American) and ice hockey.</p>
